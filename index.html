<p>A closed beta of our first productivity tool - Parallel Learning - is coming.  Registration will open soon.  <b>Parallel Learning is much more efficient than traditional methods of study</b> which means that whoever starts using it has basically two choices:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>greatly decrease</b> their <b>time spent studying</b> while achieving the same (or better!) results</li>
  <li><b>greatly increase the amount and quality</b> of what they learn while spending the same time studying</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you are a student, a professional who understands the importance of learning in achieving success, or whether you just love to learn, we believe Parallel Learning can greatly improve your life... and this is just the beginning - the other components of our revolutionary Exobrainstation are in the making.  Stay tuned.</p>

<p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Very often &hellip; ignorance of the way to learn, more than the effort of learning itself, breaks the spirit of those who are anxious to do so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"><b>Alberti</b> (15th century painter and writer)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>

<p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Our cultures don&#39;t encourage us to think much about learning. Instead we regard it as something that just happens to us.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2">But learning must itself consist of sets of skills we grow ourselves; we start with only some of them and slowly grow the rest.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2">Why don&#39;t more people keep on learning more and better learning skills?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2">Because it&#39;s not rewarded right away, its payoff has a long delay.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"><b>Marvin Minsky</b> (21st century philosopher and scientist, expert in cognitive sciences and artificial intelligence)</span></p>

<p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Not much has changed since the 15th century.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Have you ever dreamt about living in a world where everyone around you seemed relaxed and happy instead of being frustrated and aggressive? Where there were no apparent social inequalities leading to social conflicts, tragedies, violence and crime? Where people were enjoying their work and not just enduring it and waiting for the weekend to come? Where access to health services was fast and easy for everyone because there were enough health-care professionals who were not only highly skilled but also passionate about helping others? How about living in a world where you and those closest to you were free from fear of serious diseases like AIDS or cancer as the majority of them had already been eliminated thanks to the ultrafast advancement of science and technology?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The key to achieving all that (and more) is to help people fulfil their full potential and become self-actualised human beings.&nbsp; The key is to give everyone access to the best education and help them be more effective by assisting them in staying more focused, more organised and in managing their actions. There is a genius in each of us and we want to make it much easier for everyone to set that genius free and to become successful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>There are three building blocks of success:</span></p><ul class="c8 lst-kix_44efk1se5cln-0 start"><li class="c0 c7"><span class="c5">Passion </span><span>to fuel one&#39;s </span><span class="c5">Vision </span><span>and </span><span class="c5">Actions</span><span>.</span></li><li class="c0 c7"><span>Vision to let one see the goal and the road before them and allow one to define Actions required to achieve that goal.</span></li><li class="c0 c7"><span>Action to move one towards the goal and thus realise their Vision. &nbsp;</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>All three elements are required for success. If even one of them is missing in one&#39;s life then it is very difficult, if not impossible, for such an individual to become successful. Passion and Vision without Action gets one nowhere - one wants a change (Passion), one knows what one wants to change and what has to be done in order to achieve that (Vision) but one does nothing so nothing actually changes. Passion and Action without Vision means that even though one wants a change (Passion) and that desire motivates them to act (Action), without Vision one&#39;s goals (if defined at all) change and one&#39;s actions lead such a person in random directions and thus nobody can tell where they will eventually arrive (and since some of their actions cancel each other they may end up at the same place they started from).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Since there are as many different Visions as there are people, how can we help all of them with just one product? Irrespective of what they do people of the third millennium have the following needs:</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&bull; they need to manage themselves - their personal lives and their projects,</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&bull; they need to retain knowledge they possess,</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&bull; they need to acquire new knowledge,</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&bull; and they need to do all these things in an effective manner</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>These needs are answered by </span><span class="c5">Cognitive Sciences and Management</span><span>,&nbsp; most people are not interested in these two fields though and therefore will never become proficient in either of them. In other words, they lack knowledge and skills which would allow them to&nbsp; realise their full potential and, as such, are not nearly as effective in their daily endeavours as they could be. Of course, this problem could be remedied by hiring a team of professionals whose sole purpose would be to help their employer </span><span class="c5">achieve high efficiency</span><span>&nbsp;in both learning and staying organised, but the majority of people cannot afford such a solution. And this is where we step in. This is why we can help everyone, irrespective of their individual circumstances. We are here to provide everybody with their own personal support team consisting of a manager, a personal assistant, a tutor and more. We do that by carefully selecting the best (i.e. proven, effective and easy to apply) achievements of Cognitive Sciences and Management seamlessly melted together into The Method and then shaped into the state-of-the-art software solution in the furnace of cutting-edge technology.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>We create software which helps everyone pursue their Passion by assisting them in becoming conscious of their Vision and aiding them in managing their Actions. Our software can help populate the Earth with highly successful and self-actualised human beings. This is our way of making the world better.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span></span></p><h4 class="c9">
